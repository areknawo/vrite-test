## The Stack

No good tool is built without using good tools, and Vrite Editor is no different. Before getting into WYSIWYG editors, I [extensively researched available RTE frameworks](https://vrite.io/blog/best-js-rich-text-editors-for-2023/), that could provide the tooling and functionality I was looking for. Ultimately, I picked [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) and underlying [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) â€” IMO, the best tools currently available for all kinds of WYSIWYG editors.

Aside from that, I used:

- [Solid.js](https://solidjs.com/) â€” the super-fast UI framework;
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) â€” for styling with Tailwind-like atomic CSS;
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) â€” build tool for putting it all together;
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) - Node.js framework;

The results came out pretty nicely! ðŸŒŸ
