### Mobile Support

The other thing that's quite hard to get right in a web-based WYSIWYG editor, is **mobile support**.

Initially, I thought that a good editing experience on the mobile platform can only be achieved with a native mobile app, so why bother trying to get it right on the mobile web?

Well, ultimately I tried to add mobile support to Vrite Editor anyway, and, to my surprise, it turned out pretty good!

There were many things that needed optimization — and some that still do. From the general layout, toolbar, and the UI of block elements to formatting and block content menus — everything had to be in some way optimized or completely changed for mobile.

Now, there’s still some work to be done here. Monaco editor [doesn’t work well for mobile](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/246), and some “optional” features weren’t yet optimized (like link previews or comments).

Still, with the work already done, Vrite Editor is usable and actually quite comfortable on mobile.
