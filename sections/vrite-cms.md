## Vrite CMS

In case you enjoy using Vrite Editor, you might be interested in a larger project that it’s a part of — “Vrite CMS”, or simply “Vrite”.

[Vrite is a headless CMS for technical content](https://vrite.io/), providing editing and management tools to work with content like technical product documentation, programming blogs, etc. Basically, it’s my answer to (what I consider) a lack of good tooling focused on this kind of content.

Beyond just the Vrite Editor, you get additional features, like:

- 
  Kanban dashboard for content management;

- API and Webhooks;

- Extension system for easy publishing to popular platforms;

- Real-time collaboration;

- and more!

Since Vrite (and Vrite Editor for that matter) is currently in **Public Beta**, new features and improvements are in active development. The best way to try it out right now is through the hosted version at [app.vrite.io](https://app.vrite.io/) (free while in Beta) with better self-hosting support in the works.
