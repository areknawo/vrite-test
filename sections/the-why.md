## The “Why?”

In software development, Markdown is basically omnipresent. You can find it in READMEs, powering software blogs, and serving as one of the primary content formatting methods when **Rich Text Editing** (RTE) is required.

Markdown is awesome! But, when writing 1000 words+ articles, I quickly feel the need for a better experience. For years, I’ve used [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) — an open-source, in-browser Markdown editor — for editing all kinds of long-format Markdown text. That said, given my recent experience with WYSIWYG editors, I thought I could do something better.

That’s how I created **Vrite Editor** — an open-source Rich Text Editor, focused on good user experience and technical writing.
