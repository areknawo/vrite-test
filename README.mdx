# Vrite: Open-Source Developer Content Platform

I’ve created an [open-source](https://github.com/vriteio/vrite), [minimalistic WYSIWYG Markdown editor](https://editor.vrite.io/) to easily create and export Markdown and HTML content on the go, without any sign-up required!

Here’s “Why?”, “How?”, and other questions answered!

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");

```

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for website development. It is a lightweight, interpreted language that allows developers to add interactive elements, such as animations, form validation, and dynamic content, to web pages. JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming with the help of Node.js, allowing developers to build entire web applications.

# Important note

Previously Vrite was known as **CodeWrite** - a browser extension with WYSIWYG editor and one-click publishing system.
