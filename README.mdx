# Vrite Editor: Open-Source WYSIWYG Markdown Editor

I’ve created an [open-source](https://github.com/vriteio/vrite), [minimalistic WYSIWYG Markdown editor](https://editor.vrite.io/) to easily create and export Markdown and HTML content on the go, without any sign-up required!

Here’s “Why?”, “How?”, and other questions answered!

Testing

<Note
  testing="hello"
  thisIsATest
  value={[1, 2, 3, { hello: 3, t: true }]}
>
  Be sure to read the `index.md` files first.
</Note>

```javascript title=""test.js" npm2yarn
console.log("Hello World");
```

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for website development. It is a lightweight, interpreted language that allows developers to add interactive elements, such as animations, form validation, and dynamic content, to web pages. JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming with the help of Node.js, allowing developers to build entire web applications.
